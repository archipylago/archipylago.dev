Last week we hosted our first meetup at [Valohai](https://valohai.com)'s office. Big thanks to them for hosting the event and helping us get our events up and running. The event was a lovely success.

For the first event, we had two talks and a good community discussion.

## Python Packaging (PEP 517/518) by Aarni Koskela

## Debugging Python by Juha-Matti Santala

The second talk was done by me. I brought my recent PyCon Sweden talk **Debugging Python** to the meetup.
