![fi.pycon.org, PyCon Finland 2025, Friday October 17th, Jyväskylä. Call for Proposals open, early bird tickets available.](/assets/img/posts/pyconfi-banner.png)

[PyCon Finland](https://fi.pycon.org) returns after a 9-year hiatus as part of the Plone Conf in Jyväskylä **17.10.2025**.

The event is scheduled between 12 and 18 which means you can take the 6.54 train from Turku to make it to Jyväskylä in time and be home before midnight with the evening train.

If we have more people from Turku planning to go, it would be great to travel together.

We are planning the trip in our [TurkuDev Discord](https://archipylago.dev/discord) in #archipylago-goes-pyconfi channel. If you're interested in joining, come say hi in the channel. If you want to join the trip but don't want to use Discord, you can email me at juhamattisantala@gmail.com.

Everyone will buy their own PyCon Finland ticket and eventually train tickets but depending on how many people are joining, I'll try to coordinate something with VR to see if we could get some sort of a cabinet for the trip. So buy your conference ticket now and let's coordinate the train ticket purchases later.

The [Call for Proposals](https://2025.ploneconf.org/call-for-papers) for the conference is open until 31.7. so if you have something you wanna share, submit your talk! And if you get selected, we can offer you an opportunity to practice your talk in our October meetup.
