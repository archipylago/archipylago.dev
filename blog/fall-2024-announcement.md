After a relaxing summer break, we're ready to return to our regular event schedule.

[Our first event](https://www.meetabit.com/events/archipylago-5-september-2024-at-sofokus) of the fall takes place Thursday 12.9. 18.00 at [Sofokus' office](https://sofokus.com). Big thanks to them for hosting the meetup.

The registration will open Thursday 29.8. at 12.00 via [Meetabit](https://www.meetabit.com/events/archipylago-5-september-2024-at-sofokus).

## Talks

**Robert Siipola** joins us to talk about vector embeddings: what they are, how you use them and how to visualize them.

**Calle Laakkonen** will show us how to build REST and GraphQL APIs in Python.

Learn more about the talks from [the event page](https://www.meetabit.com/events/archipylago-5-september-2024-at-sofokus).

## We're looking for sponsors and speakers

The plans for the rest of the fall are still in progress. If your company uses Python and wants to **host an evening with Turku's finest Python developers**, get in touch with us either via email (juhamattisantala@gmail.com) or in [TurkuDev Discord's](/discord) #archipylago-general channel. You can find more information about hosting our meetups at our [for companies page](/for-companies).

Archipylago exists to bring together the local Python community so we can share our experiences and knowledge, learn from each other and meet new people. To make that happen, we'd love to hear from you! If you'd like to **do a talk in our events**, get in touch! We welcome you whether you're first time speaker, have done it a hundred times or anything in between. And if you want, we can provide assistance in figuring out what to talk about and prepping the talk. You can find more specs from our [for speakers page](/for-speakers).

And as always, tell about us to your friends and colleagues who work with Python. We rely on word of mouth to spread the word.
