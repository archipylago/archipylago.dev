![Magdalena Stenius: "Good-enough SRE for production software projects" and Mikko Harju: "Implementing and using Rule-based systems in Python". archipylago at Taiste, Thu 14.3.2024 18-20.30](/assets/img/posts/archipylago-blog-march-meetup-coming.png)

Our next event is coming in two weeks. Our good friends at [Taiste](https://taiste.fi) are hosting us this time and we have two excellent talks booked for the event.

## Talks

### Magdalena Stenius - Good-enough SRE for production software projects

Magdalena has been a pivotal part in Turku's Python community as an organizer of Turku\.py community and we're excited she's joining us as a speaker for this event. She works at Wolt and this month she's sharing her experience in building good-enough SRE practices in their team.

During her talk, we can expect an introduction to the theme as well as a practical example from Wolt's personalisation-api service that caters their global user base daily.

### Mikko Harju - Implementing and using Rule-based systems in Python

Mikko is a Technology Director at Taiste and he will introduce us to the world of rule-based systems and how to implement and use them in Python. He will show how to use [py-rete](https://github.com/cmaclell/py_rete) project to implement Rete engines in native Python.

## Practicalities

The event is free but we have limited seating so you need to sign up at [our Meetabit page](https://meetabit.com/events/archipylago-3-march-2024-at-taiste/).

The meetup takes place <time datetime="2024-03-14">14.3.2024</time> <time datetime="18:00">18.00</time> - <time datetime="20:30">20.30</time> after which we'll continue open discussions at [Saaristobaari](https://www.saaristobaari.fi/), one block from the venue.
