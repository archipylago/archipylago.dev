It's the time of the year again when jingle bells are jingling.

We had a wonderful second year of archipylago and that's thanks to everyone who's been part of the meetup: partners, speakers and participants alike.

And 2026 is just around the corner and we'll kick off the year right out of the gate on 15.1. with a meetup at Valohai. To have a great meetup, we'll need some speakers though! If you'd like to talk about something next spring, let us know by either emailing at juhamattisantala@gmail.com or sending a message to #archipylago-general in [TurkuDev Discord](/discord).

If you'd like to talk but don't quite know what you could talk about, we've listed some ideas in https://archipylago.dev/for-speakers/ and we're more than happy to help you figure it out if you reach out.

We're hosting a casual Turku Dev Afterwork on Monday 29.12. 17.00 onwards at John Scott's if you want to catch up with people during the holidays. A kind of "talk APIs, drink IPAs" type of deal, if you wish.

Happy holidays!
