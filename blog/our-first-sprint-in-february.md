After [a successful kick off meetup](/blog/archipylago-1-debugging-python-and-packaging) last week at [Valohai](https://valohai.com), it's time to direct our focus on the next event: our first **sprint**.

The sprint will take place Saturday, 24.2.2024 12-16 at [SparkUp](https://sparkup.businessturku.fi/en/), Tykistökatu 4B.

In [our introduction blog post](/blog/from-turku-import-archipylago), I described our sprint concept as

> For **sprints**, we are organizing hands-on "bring your own laptop" style events, possibly on Saturdays where we either go through some workshops, work on open source projects or take a look at new tech or library and hack away together.

For this first event, we picked a theme of **testing**. There won't be a strict program for the day, rather a 4-hour window where you can join a group of fellow Pythonistas to work on things and learn new things.

## How does it work?

The "recommended" approach to this event is to clone AutomationPanda's [bulldoggy-reminders-app](https://github.com/AutomationPanda/bulldoggy-reminders-app) and use it as an example app to write tests for. You can choose your own tools that you want to learn: you might want to write unit tests with [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) or [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) or explore end-to-end testing with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) or [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

If more people choose to do the same thing, they can group up and learn together. You can do [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) or [ensemble programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_programming#Mob_programming) and in addition to learning more about testing, make new friends and pick up a new approach to coding!

But you are also welcome to use this time slot as a "get-stuff-done" time for writing or improving tests for your own projects or contribute to an open source project.

Finally, at the end of the day, let's do a short demo round where people can share what they worked on and what they learned.

## Join the event

To join, sign up at [Meetabit](https://meetabit.com/events/archipylago-2-february-2024-at-sparkup), bring your own laptop (and remember a charger!) and an open mind.

This event does not have a food/drink sponsorship so take care of your own nutrition needs during the day. There's a [K-Market Station](https://www.k-ruoka.fi/kauppa/k-market-station) across the street.

Thank you [SparkUp](https://sparkup.businessturku.fi/en/) for providing us with the space for the event ❤️.
