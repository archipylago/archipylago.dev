# Information for companies

archipylago is a non-profit community for Python developers in Turku area.

With the help of our partner companies, we host meetups in their offices to bring the developer community together to learn, get inspired, meet other developers and learn about the companies.

Our meetups happen on Thursday evenings, 18.00-20.30 and consist of a short company introduction, 2 talks about Python related topics, food and drinks and time to sosialize and hang out.

## Responsibilities

We as the **organizers** take care of booking the speakers, handling marketing and registrations and bringing the community to your office.

You as the sponsoring **company** in return offer us space for the event with AV setup (minimum of a display that we can connect laptops to) as well as food and drinks for the participants. You are more than welcome to share the event both before and after in your channels.

How many people we bring in always depends on the available space and company: we usually aim to have space for 20-50 people. That's usually been the amount of people offices in Turku are able to accomodate.

## Schedule

A rough schedule for our events looks like this:

18.00 Doors open  
18.10 Hello from hosting company
18.20 1st talk
18.50 Break  
19.10 2nd talk
19.40 Socializing  
20.30 Post-meetup discussions at a local pub

but the exact timings inside the event can shift around.

And we're always open to discuss new ideas and formats if you have something specific in mind.
