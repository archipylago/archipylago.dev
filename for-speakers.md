# Information for speakers

We welcome speakers of all kind to give talks in archipylago meetups. The main idea for the meetup is to have space for developers to share with each other what they know, what they've learned and what experiences they have. You can be an experienced conference/meetup speaker or a first-timer; a senior developer or a hobbyist. We aim to have a space that is welcoming and safe to experiment with public speaking.

## Practicalities

By default, we expect talks to be:

- up to 30 minutes in length (if you have a longer talk in mind, let's discuss!)
- in English
- about topics relevant to Python developers
- not direct product or company marketing
- in line with our [Code of Conduct](/#code-of-conduct)

A typical talk has some slides and/or live coding sections but we're open to all sorts of creative talks so don't let that typical setup stop you.

## What can you talk about?

If you'd like to give a talk but don't yet know quite what about, here are some ideas:

- **Python tools and libraries** are common things to talk about. Have you found an interesting tool or library that you use in your daily projects and want to share that with others. There's so many out there that it's likely not everybody knows about the same tools you use.
- **Project learnings** give inspiration and ideas to others. If you've worked on a work project that you can talk about or a hobby project recently, come share what you've learned.
- **Tools for developers** that are not exactly Python-specific (like editors, command line tools, deployment, etc).
- **What's new in Python and ecosystem**: tools and languages evolve over time but it can be hard to keep up in the daily grind. Why not share some of the new exciting things with the community?

Juhis has shared more ideas with examples in his blog: [Talk ideas for new and experienced speakers](https://hamatti.org/posts/talk-ideas-for-new-and-experienced-speakers/) that you can check out for inspiration.

If you want help with ideation, crafting the talk and practice before the meetup, we're happy to help you out!
